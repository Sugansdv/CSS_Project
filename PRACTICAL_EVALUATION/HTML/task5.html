            <p>Orbiting in space no more, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams returned to Earth on Tuesday (March 18, 2025), hitching a different ride home to close out a saga that began with a bungled test flight more than nine months ago.</p>
            <p>The duo had originally launched aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft but encountered technical issues that delayed their return. Eventually, they made their way back safely aboard SpaceX's Dragon capsule, landing in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
            <p>The successful return marks the end of an extended and unexpected mission, during which the astronauts contributed to scientific experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and assisted in station maintenance.</p>
            <p>NASA officials have confirmed that both astronauts are in good health and will undergo post-mission evaluations before reuniting with their families.</p>
